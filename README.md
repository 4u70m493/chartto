# chartto - dashboard for Todoist

Charts from Todoist data.

(Todoist still has only daily/weekly completed tasks counts and primitive graphs ([productivity view](https://todoist.com/help/articles/how-to-use-the-productivity-view). Seeing more really helps.)

(There are some extensions though: [ganttify](https://todoist.com/integrations/apps/ganttify), etc.)

## Features

## Usage

### Requirements
You can install them by running:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

This creates a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#:~:text=A%20virtual%20environment%20is%20a,part%20of%20your%20operating%20system.) with all dependencies for this project installed.


## Why

4 years ago I wanted to build this, but didn't, because [dolytics](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dolytics) project was just declared and I thought, that it would be finished.
Unfortunately it never got updates and never launched.

Today (03.02.2022) I saw this and decided, that I'd better finish my charts for Todoist project.  

## Gratitude

I'll be really grateful for [a book](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/walsk) or just a word of thanks. :-)

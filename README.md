### Requirements
You can install them by running:

pip install -r helpers/requirements.txt

Common recommendation — install them in virtualenv (or whatever is the most trendy tool to make it isolated).

### Note about the name
I'm sorry to use the word "todoist" in the name, but I've found another repo called [todoist-shortcuts](https://github.com/mgsloan/todoist-shortcuts) (very cool browser extension, btw, highly recommended to see/use/contribute/sponsor!). 
They're fine with the name usage and even recommend this extension in the [official shortcuts documentation](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205063212) (check the "Quick tip - if you're looking for more...").

The reason behind this name choice is the following: I know, that many people would like to have their Todoist stats visualized. And I guess the name will make this repo more discoverable => more active (ideally happy!) users.

But initially the app was called "chartto" and I will leave this name everywhere in the code (for now).
